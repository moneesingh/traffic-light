This is a Traffic light simulator application.
Once the application starts, it prompts users for 3 integer inputs which determines how long each light will display.
For simplicity, the valid values are between 1-10 seconds.

One the application starts, user can enter 'ctrl+c' to exit the traffic light safely.
