This is a Traffic light simulator application.

This application is tested with python3.11 and MAC OS, so I highly encourage using python3+ on debian unix platform.
I have not tested it with other platforms, but it may work.


Once the application starts, it prompts users for 3 integer inputs which determines how long each light will display.
For simplicity, the valid values are between 1-10 seconds.

Once the application starts, user can enter 'ctrl+c' to exit the traffic light safely.

Running traffic light simulator

```
git clone https://github.com/moneesingh/traffic-light.git
cd traffic-light
python main.py

#python -m venv env1
#source env1/bin/activate
#cd env1
#git clone https://github.com/moneesingh/traffic-light.git
#cd traffic-light
#pip install -r requirements.txt
#python main.py -->
```

Note:
There is also a tar file which can be downloaded from github. But I recommend using git clone and running locally from cloned repo
https://github.com/moneesingh/traffic-light/blob/main/kumar_monee_coding_challenge.tar
The packaging and testcases are still in progress.
