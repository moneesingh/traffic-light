This is a Traffic light simulator application.
This application is tested with python3.11, so I highly encourage using later version of python 

Once the application starts, it prompts users for 3 integer inputs which determines how long each light will display.
For simplicity, the valid values are between 1-10 seconds.

Once the application starts, user can enter 'ctrl+c' to exit the traffic light safely.
